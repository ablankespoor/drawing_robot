# drawing_robot

Project to design and build a wall-hanging drawing robot.

Along with the end results (drawings), this project is a way to learn more about programming and CNC control.  A Raspberry Pi will be used for the computations.   Two NEMA 17 motors will control the X-Y position of the pen.  A lot of work has already been done on drawing robots, and may be incorporated into this project (with proper citations).
